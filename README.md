WP Session Manager
==================

Session management for WordPress.

Description
-----------

Adds `$_SESSION` functionality to WordPress, leveraging the database where needed to power multi-server installations.

Every visitor, logged in or not, will be issued a session. Session data will be stored in the WordPress database by default
to deal with load balancing issues if multiple application servers are being used. In addition, the session collection will
also be stored _in memory_ for rapid use within WordPress.

Session data stored in the database can be encrypted at rest for better security.

Installation
------------

**Manual Installation**

1. Upload the entire `/wp-session-manager` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Use `$_SESSION` in your code.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

**How do I add session variables?**

Merely use the superglobal `$_SESSION` array:

```
$_SESSION['user_name'] = 'User Name';                            // A string
$_SESSION['user_contact'] = array( 'email' => 'user@name.com' ); // An array
$_SESSION['user_obj'] = new WP_User( 1 );                        // An object
```

**How long do session variables live?**

This depends on your PHP installation's configuration. Please read the [PHP manual](http://php.net/manual/en/session.configuration.php)
for more details on configuration.

**Can I use this plugin without creating new tables?**

Absolutely! As of version 2.0, this plugin will create a new table for WordPress to store session data. In general, this is more efficient long-term than using options for data storage. However, if your system does not allow creating a table, add the following to `wp-config.php` to use the options table instead:

```
define( 'WP_SESSION_USE_OPTIONS', true );
```
