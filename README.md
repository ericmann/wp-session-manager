# WP Session Manager [![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url] [![Coverage Status][coveralls-image]][coveralls-url]

Session management for WordPress.

Description
-----------

Adds `$_SESSION` functionality to WordPress, leveraging the database where needed to power multi-server installations.

Every visitor, logged in or not, will be issued a session. Session data will be stored in the WordPress database by default
to deal with load balancing issues if multiple application servers are being used. In addition, the session collection will
also be stored _in memory_ for rapid use within WordPress.

Session data stored in the database can be encrypted at rest for better security.

Installation
------------

**Manual Installation**

1. Upload the entire `/wp-session-manager` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Use `$_SESSION` in your code.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

**How do I add session variables?**

Merely use the superglobal `$_SESSION` array:

```
$_SESSION['user_name'] = 'User Name';                            // A string
$_SESSION['user_contact'] = array( 'email' => 'user@name.com' ); // An array
$_SESSION['user_obj'] = new WP_User( 1 );                        // An object
```

**How long do session variables live?**

This depends on your PHP installation's configuration. Please read the [PHP manual](http://php.net/manual/en/session.configuration.php)
for more details on configuration.

**Can I use this plugin without creating new tables?**

Absolutely! As of version 2.0, this plugin will create a new table for WordPress to store session data. In general, this is more efficient long-term than using options for data storage. However, if your system does not allow creating a table, add the following to `wp-config.php` to use the options table instead:

```
define( 'WP_SESSION_USE_OPTIONS', true );
```

**I get an error saying my PHP version is out of date. Why?**

PHP 5.6 was designated end-of-life and stopped receiving security patches in December 2018. PHP 7.0 was _also_ marked end-of-life in December 2018. The minimum version of PHP supported by WP Session Manager is now PHP 7.1.

If your server is running an older version of PHP, the session system _will not work!_ To avoid triggering a PHP error, the plugin will instead output this notice to upgrade and disable itself silently. You won't see a PHP error, but you also won't get session support.

Reach out to your hosting provider or system administrator to upgrade your server.

**I get an error saying another plugin is setting up a session. What can I do?**

WP Session Manager overrides PHP's default session implementation with its own custom handler. Unfortunately, we can't swap in a new handler if a session is already active. This plugin hooks into the `plugins_loaded` hook to set things up as early as possible, but if you have code in _another_ plugin (or your theme) that attempts to invoke `session_start()` before WP Session Manager loads, then the custom handler won't work at all.

Inspect your other plugins and try to find the one that's interfering. Then, reach out to the developer to explain the conflict and see if they have a fix.
